The system ensures security through user authentication and encryption techniques. It provides administrators with tools for creating and managing exams, monitoring user activity, and generating reports.

Technologies Used:

Java : Core programming language for development.

Hibernate : Object-relational mapping for simplified database interactions.

Spring : Infrastructure support for managing components and implementing business logic.

Spring Boot : Streamlined development of production-ready applications.

REST API : Enables standardized and scalable communication between components.

Postman : Used for testing and documenting the REST API.

These technologies collectively contribute to a robust and efficient Online Examination System.
